This file has 4 seprate classes

  1:the first displays a right triangle made of stars
    It adds one star for each additional row it displays
  
  2:this class displays a right trianlge made of stars that starts with a number off stars equal to the number of rows that will be shown.
    it does this by taking commandline input and subtracting one each time it iterates.
    
  3:this class creates an equalaterial triangle that follows a patter of adding two stars, one on each side, to the triangle.
    it does this by multiplying the current row value by 2 and adding 1 to the result. 
    The current row value starts at zero and incriments postively after each loop of dispaying stars.
    it also displays spaces by taking the commandline input and adding that many spaces, removing one for each line printed
    
  4:this class creates an equalaterial triangle that follows a patter of removing two stars, one on each side, from the triangle.
    it does this by multiplying the current row value by 2 and adding.
    This value is the value entered in the commandline and incriments negatively after each loop of dispaying stars.
    it also displays spaces for each line printed untill the very last loop
